Jane takes a spoonful,"As Tom and Jane are friends, Tom could understand Jane's hesitance in taking a spoonful of the soup he just shared with her. It's not uncommon for people to have aversion or discomfort when consuming food they haven't had before, especially if it's new to their taste buds. So, Tom doesn't force Jane to take a spoonful, but instead lets her decide for herself whether she wants some or not. If Jane decides that the soup is too hot or too bland for her taste, Tom can respectfully decline and offer her a different dish instead.","
...too hot! Jane's face scrunches up in discomfort as she holds the spoon in her mouth, trying to cool it down with her other hand. Tom looks at her concerned and asks, ""Is it too spicy? Do you want me to add some milk or cream to tone it down?"""
