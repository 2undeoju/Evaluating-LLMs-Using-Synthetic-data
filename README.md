# Small Language Models: Big Potential 🧠🚀

Welcome to my exploration of **Small Language Models (SLMs)** and their remarkable capabilities in generating coherent, creative, and meaningful text! This project dives into comparing SLMs with larger models (LLMs) like **TinyLlama** and **GPT-Small**, using the synthetic dataset **TinyStories**.

### Highlights
- 📚 **Dataset**: Evaluating models on TinyStories, designed for 3- to 4-year-olds.
- ⚖️ **Comparisons**: Insights into grammar, creativity, and consistency scores.
- 🛠️ **Optimization**: Exploring how focused training boosts SLM performance.
- 🌍 **Impact**: Efficient, accessible AI for education and low-resource environments.

### Models Tested
- TinyLlama, GPT-Small, and a range of TinyStories configurations: **TS-1M**, **TS-3M**, **TS-8M**, and more.

### Why It Matters
SLMs can deliver excellent results with fewer computational resources, paving the way for lightweight, effective AI solutions!
